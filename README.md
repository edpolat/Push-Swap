# Push-Swap
A sorting algorithm project developed in C as part of the 42 curriculum. The goal is to sort a stack of integers using a limited set of operations while minimizing the number of moves. This repository includes the push_swap and checker programs, focusing on optimization, performance, and efficient memory management.
